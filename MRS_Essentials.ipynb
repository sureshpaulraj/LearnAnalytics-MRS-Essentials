    "# Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial leverages the [jupyter notebook platform](https://jupyter.org/), and this platform may not be familiar to all of you. If you are unfamiliar with this environment, it is strongly encouraged to take a few moments and visit an introduction to using it, such as this [excellent tutorial presented at UseR2016!](https://github.com/michhar/useR2016-tutorial-jupyter).\n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage the capacities of jupyter and R together, it requires that the [appropriate R kernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) is installed on the machine running jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also requires that the version of R that the kernel points to is [Microsoft R (Server or Client)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/index).\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way of deploying these bits is to leverage the [Data Science Virtual Machine on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/microsoft-ads/standard-data-science-vm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "A very brief summary of the critical components and commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to run (or render) the current cell.\n",
    "2. Output will print to the console the notebook. You may have to scroll up to see it all.\n",
    "3. Get help for any function by typing a question mark and then its name into\n",
    "   the console: `?rxLinMod`. It will split the window, and will bring up the documentation for \n",
    "   that function below.\n",
    "4. Get help for *all* the MRS functions with: `help(\"RevoScaleR\")`\n",
    "5. Files will appear in the specified directory. You can find them by selecting File in the menu bar and selecting \"Open...\". This will open a new browser window with a file navigator.\n",
    "6. R objects can be viewed by typing `ls()` in an R cell.\n",
    "7. Run all the example code!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of hands-on exercises in the document, so while you can run the notebook from beginning to end, you will get a lot more out of it by actually walking through cell-by-cell, and filling out the corresponding exercises.\n"

    "## What is Microsoft R Server?\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical programming language R is an open-source, immensely popular\n",
    "and useful tool for data analysis and machine learning. It's widely taught in\n",
    "universities, has thousands of packages that extend its capabilities, and it's\n",
    "free!\n",
    "\n",
    "But R has two crucial limitations that make using it for big data challenging:\n",
    "1. It's single-threaded. No matter how many cores your computer has, R will only use one for its operations.\n",
    "2. It's memory-bound. All of the data you want to process has to fit into your computer's RAM. Megabytes of data? No problem. Terabytes? Trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft R Server (MRS) extends open-source R in three critical ways to overcome these limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multi-threaded Math: MRS is built with the Intel MKL Library, which enables multi-threaded \n",
    "  matrix operations - very useful for matrix-intensive operations!\n",
    "2. Parallel Algorithms:  MRS comes with a suite of functions called ScaleR that \n",
    "   allows computationally intense algorithms to be distributed across many cores\n",
    "   and/or nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "3. Data In External Memory: MRS doesn't require data to be in-memory for ScaleR algorithms to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The native data store is the 'eXternal Data Frame', or XDF file. This file is\n",
    "   optimized for data analysis in a number of ways (see below), but MRS also\n",
    "  works well with databases, HDFS, Spark, and so on."

    "## The XDF File\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to store bigger-than-memory data for MRS is to create an\n",
    "'eXternal Data Frame' (XDF) file. XDF files are optimized for fast, distributed\n",
    "computation in a few essential ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data is written to disk in chunks of N rows. This makes it natural to\n",
    "   read chunks of data, either in serial or for distribution to nodes, and\n",
    "   easy to append new data to an existing XDF file without re-writing the \n",
    "   entire file.\n",
    "2. Within each chunk, values are stored column-wise. In statistics and machine\n",
    "   learning, it's often more useful to have fast access to an entire column\n",
    "   than fast access to an entire record (e.g., when calculating a mean)\n",
    "3. Essential stats, like the low and high values of numeric variables and the \n",
    "   unique levels of categorical variables, are pre-computed when the XDF file \n",
    "   is created or modified, providing a quick overview of the dataset without\n",
    "   processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create \"composite\" XDF files in which chunks of data spread across\n",
    "many files are treated as one XDF - useful when you're working with a \n",
    "distributed file system like HDFS."

    "\n",

    "- carrier: the shorthand code for the airline operating the flight\n",
    "- tailnum: the tail number (and unique identifier) for each plane\n",
    "- flight: the flight number\n",
    "- origin: the origin airport - New York's JFK and LaGuardia (LGA), and New Jersey's Newark (EWR)\n",
