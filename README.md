In this repository, you will find a set of materials for learning about Microsoft R.

The primary content is contained within the .ipynb files, which correspond to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks. These files are effectively just JSON files that are rendered by jupyter kernels so that they become web applications that are live documents that render analysis results when you run them.

If you are editing these files on your local machine, make sure you have an appropriate Jupyter kernel installed, and simply navigate to the .ipynb file in the file browser opened by the web browser once you have started jupyter.

In addition to the notebooks, license file, and this readme, there are some additional resources included in the "Resources" sub-directory. These are simply scripts that make sure that the relevant packages and datasets are available when you run notebooks, and they are called within the notebooks.
